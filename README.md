# getCirclePoints

I'm usign [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) to make my games. While creating games, i needed to make a game with wheel and wheel containes couple of items like starts and job pictures. Here is an pic:

So first of all i need to place those items on exact points so i wrote this function: getCirclePoints.

It basicly returns an object array. It starts on top of that wheel. You can use these for anything, anywhere.

After a couple of tweeks you can create something like this: (star's and job pictures pointed with function).
